            I am a big fan of <strong>Arduino</strong> microcontrollers.
            They are very useful for all sorts of DIY projects.
            <strong><a href="https://hackaday.io/discover" title="Hackaday">Hackaday</a></strong> is a wonderful place to discover projects other people have made or are working on.
            An Arduino can do everything you need whether you are trying to build a

            I didn't have trouble with this assignment.
            I actually refer to the Mozilla docs all the time for HTML, CSS, and Javascript as they are some of the best in my personal opinion.
            I have been writing a fair amount of HTML recently for various reasons, so all of the tags/elements mentioned in the reading were already very familiar to me except for <strong> - I am used to using <b> for bold text and wasn't aware that there is an alternative.
            This was my first time using FTP though, so I am glad I got to learn and experience something new!
