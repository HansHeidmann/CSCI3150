        <h1>Basic HTML Animals</h1>
        <p>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</p>
        <h2>The Llama</h2>
        <p>Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.</p>
        <h2>The Anaconda</h2>
        <p>The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.</p>

        <h1>Looking at lists</h1>
        <p>Turn the following list of my favorite vegetables into an unordered list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cucumber</li>
            <li>Broccoli</li>
            <li>Asparagus</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Turn the following directions into an ordered list.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First knock on the door</li>
            <li>When prompted, say the magic word</li>
            <li>Wait for at least 5 seconds</li>
            <li>Turn the handle and push</li>
        </ol>

        <hr>

        <h1>Emphasis and importance</h1>

        <p>There are two things I care about â€” <strong>music</strong> and <strong>friends</strong>. Someday I <em>might</em> be able to get my friends interested in each other, <em>and</em> my music!</p>

    The color for the h2 elements, but not h1, is changed from purple to green when the CSS for h1, h2 is modified as instructed.
    This is because h1 is readdresed further down in the CSS and h1 is overwritten to be purple instead of green.
    After this I changed the CSS colors for pretty much everything.
    I did a little bit of my own research and discovered that you can actually style <hr> elements, so I added height of 5px and increased the border-width to 5px as well.
    After increasing the size of both the border and border-radius for the lists, I realized I needed more padding on the left side so I increased that to 25px.
    I learned that you can modify the list-style-type for both kinds of lists and changed it so my unordered list uses a square instead of a circle.
    I changed the color for the <strong> and <em> tags to black. It doesn't look perfect, but seems to look a little better.
    I also figured out how to add text shadow, which probably isn't the best thing for a visually impaired reader but I thought it was pretty cool.

    I didn't have much trouble if any with this assignment since I already have a fair amount of experience using HTML and CSS.
    Still, I found it entertaining to revisit the basic and learn a few additional things to improve my fleuncy in both languages.
    JSFiddle is definitely a very useful tool that I had discovered on accident in the past and totally forgotten about until this assignment.
